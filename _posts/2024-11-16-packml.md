<h3>Introduction</h3>
This post describes an implementation the Point 85 Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) solution for manufacturers having a PackML machine interface. PackML (Packaging Machine Language) is a standard defined by the Organization for Machine Automation and Control (OMAC) and by the International Society of Automation's Technical Report 88 (ISA-TR88.00.02-2015). 

Point85 is an open source OEE solution available by download from GitHub [here](https://github.com/point85/OEE-Designer). For more information about this solution, please see the *Point 85 OEE User Guide* in the docs folder.

The OPC Foundation has a companion specification for OPC UA tags [here](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/PackML/v101/docs/4.2).  GitHub has the [PackML nodeset definitions](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-Nodeset/tree/latest/PackML).

<h3>OEE Tag Data</h3>
OEE is the product of equipment availability, performance rate and quality rate each expressed as a percentage. The time-loss model (see <a href="../../../../../index.html">Introduction</a>) is used to accumulate time in loss categories (or “no loss” if the equipment is running normally in the PackML Execute state). For availability and performance states during transitions a PackML tag (for example StopReason.ID and StopReason.Value) can be mapped to an OEE reason.

The OEE reason is associated with one of the following time "buckets":
- **Not Scheduled (Calendar)**: this is non-working time. Non-working periods (e.g. holidays) typically are planned in the work schedule that is assigned to a machine
- **Unscheduled (Calendar)**: working time when the machine is not scheduled for normal production (e.g. an R&D or pilot test run) and might be defined by the machine’s work schedule.
- **Planned Downtime (Availability)**: working time when the machine is not scheduled for normal production but the activity is intended to support production (e.g. planned preventive maintenance).
- **Unplanned Downtime (Availability)**: working time when the machine is not available due to an unexpected fault (e.g. drive failure or jam).
- **Setup (Availability)**: working time when the machine is being changed over in order to run new material.
- **Stoppages (Performance)**: minor or short periods of time when the machine is not producing as expected (such as a blocked or starved condition). PackML tags EquipmentInterlock.Blocked and EquipmentInterlock.Starved could be used.
- **Reduced Speed (Performance)**: the machine is producing, but not at its nominal speed or may be starting up.

For quality or yield, the PackML ProdProcessedCount and ProdDefectiveCount tags could provide a production count in the good, reject/rework or startup & yield categories in the defined units of measure for the material being produced (where good production is the difference between the total and defective counts). This count has an equivalent time loss calculation by using the machine’s ideal or nominal speed.
The material being produced (and possibly the associated production order identifier) might be available as a process parameter tag.

<h3>OEE Reasons</h3>
Time loss availability and performance reasons (causes) are organized hierarchically by a parent "state" reason whose name matches one of the defined PackML states, e.g. "Aborted".  The OEE reason in turn maps to a time loss category, e.g. Unplanned Downtime:

The Point85 PackML solution collects the accumulated time in the states as well as the time assigned to each reason or cause.  For examples, see below.

<h3>PackML State Pareto</h3>
This Pareto chart shows the PackML availability and performance states that are not value-adding, i.e. they represent lost running time.  For example:
<img src="../../../../../resources/images/PackMLStatePareto.png" alt="PackML State Pareto" style="width:100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> 
In this chart we see that the Holding state consumed 33% of the lost performance and availability time.  Note that the actual time can be seen by hovering the cursor over the corresponding point in the cumulative line chart.

<h3>PackML Reason Pareto</h3>
This Pareto chart shows the PackML availability and performance reasons that are not value-adding, i.e. they represent lost running time.  For example:
<img src="../../../../../resources/images/PackMLReasonPareto.png" alt="PackML Reason Pareto" style="width:100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> 
In this chart we see that the “HLG” reason consumed 33% of the lost performance and availability time and the “ABT” reason 12%.  Note that the actual time can be seen by hovering the cursor over the corresponding point in the cumulative line chart.
